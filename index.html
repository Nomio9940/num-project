            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Literature Review</h2>
            Docker has been the subject of numerous studies, mainly focusing on its impact on software deployment, application isolation, and infrastructure optimization. Studies such as "Containerization and the PaaS Cloud" (Vaughan-Nichols, 2014) and "The Impact of Containerization on Microservice Architectures" (Newman, 2015) provide important context and foundation for our research.

        <section id="methodology" class="my-4 p-4 bg-white rounded shadow-md">
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Methodology</h2>
            We conducted both quantitative and qualitative research to gather data for this report. A survey of the current school web system and a comparative study of Docker's implementation in similar settings were carried out. We also performed a detailed technical analysis of Docker's features to understand its potential impact on the school's web system.

        <section id="overview" class="my-4 p-4 bg-white rounded shadow-md">
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Docker: An Overview</h2>
            Docker is an open-source platform that simplifies the creation, deployment, and running of applications by using containerization. Docker containers package an application with everything it needs to run, including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime, ensuring consistency and reducing overhead.
